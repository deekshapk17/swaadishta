        "Instructions": "\u25a2 Peel, halve and boil potatoes in a pot of water, until fork tender (not mushy). Or (pressure cook unpeeled potatoes for 5 whistles on a medium flame or in the instant pot for 8 mins, placed over a trivet. When the pressure drops, cool & peel them.)\u25a2 Crumble the potatoes, don't mash them. Keep aside., \u25a2 Mix together flour, carom seeds, salt and oil in a mixing bowl.\u25a2 Rub the flour well with your fingers or in between your palms for 3 to 4 mins to incorporate the oil. It should look like breadcrumbs and this is very important to make flaky samosa.\u25a2 Take handful of flour and press down with your fingers. It must hold shape and not crumble. This is an indication that the oil is well incorporated. (check video or photos in the post)\u25a2 Add water little by little and mix the flour to form a slightly stiff yet pliable dough. (Check pictures in the post). It should not be very soft like roti/naan dough. Cover and rest for 25 to 30 mins., \u25a2 Heat a pan with oil. Add cumin seeds.\u25a2 When they begins to sizzle, add ginger & green chilies. Fry until ginger smells aromatic, for about 30 to 60 seconds.\u25a2 Stir in the green peas and saute for 2 mins.\u25a2 Add red chilli powder, garam masala, cumin powder, chaat masala (optional) & fennel powder. Saute for 30 seconds.\u25a2 Stir in the potatoes and sprinkle salt. Mix and saute for 2 to 3 mins. Mix in coriander leaves & set aside to cool.\u25a2 Taste and add more salt if needed. If using lemon juice, add it now. Divide the mixture roughly to 10 portions., \u25a2 Knead the dough gently to smoothen a bit. Divide it to 5 portions and roll to balls. Cover the dough balls until the end, to prevent drying out.\u25a2 Grease the rolling area and then flatten a ball. Drizzle a few drops of oil.\u25a2 Begin to roll to a circle or oval shaped disc. (Around 8.5 inches long by 6.5 inches wide). It should be neither too thick nor too thin. (Watch video)\u25a2 Using a knife cut it to two semicircles. The 2 parts make 2 samosas. If the edges are too thick, gently roll it to thin down.\u25a2 Work on one part \u2013 apply water over the straight edge (towards the cut side). Join the edges to make a cone. Press down gently to seal the cone from inside as well. (Check video or photos above) (If you have trouble sticking them, make a paste of flour and water, smear that lightly & then stick)\u25a2 Fill the cone with one portion of potato masala and press down with your finger to push it inside the cone. Smear water generously on both the other edges.\u25a2 Bring the edges together and seal them by pinching off the edges together. If you prefer to make a standing samosa, make a pleat on one side. Bring back the pleat and seal it by pinching off the edges together. (Check video or photos above)\u25a2 Make sure the samosa is sealed well. Cover them with a cloth to prevent drying., \u25a2 After you make 5 samosas, begin to heat the oil until medium hot.\u25a2 Oil has to be medium hot and not very hot or cold. A piece of dough dropped in the oil should not sizzle or rise immediately. Instead you should see tiny bubbles in the oil & the dough should take a while to come up to the surface. This is the right temperature.\u25a2 Gently add as many samosas as you can to the oil and fry them on a low flame, undisturbed for few minutes (about 10 to 12 mins).\u25a2 When the crust becomes firm, increase the flame to medium. Turn them to the other side and fry until crispy and golden.\u25a2 While the first batch of samosas fry, make the rest of them. Remove the golden fried samosas to a wired rack or a steel colander. Let the temperature of oil come down slightly before you fry the next batch.\u25a2 Serve samosa with mint chutney, sweet tamarind chutney or tomato ketchup., \u25a2 Preheat the oven at 180 C or 360 F for about 20 mins. Brush each samosa generously with oil all over and place them on a prepared tray. Bake these for about 35 to 40 mins., \u25a2 Spray your samosa with oil or brush with ghee. Preheat your air fryer for 7 mins at 360 F or 180 C if required.\u25a2 Place the samosa in the air fryer basket or tray spacing them at least an inch apart from each other.\u25a2 Air fry for 12 mins, turn them to the other side and air fry for another 5 to 6 mins, or a little longer until golden and crisp. (In non-preheated air fryer air fry at 370 F or 190 C for the same time)\u25a2 Brush them with ghee or oil as required., \u25a2 Mix together cumin powder, garam masala, red chili powder and fennel in a small sauce pan. Toast them on a low heat for 30 to 60 seconds, until aromatic. Do not burn.\u25a2 Add the jaggery, tamarind paste and pour water. Mix well and simmer until slightly thick, a sauce like consistency.\u25a2 Stir in the ginger and black salt during the last 1 minute of cooking. It takes about 8 to 10 mins for the tamarind chutney to reach the right consistency.\u25a2 Taste test and add more salt, tamarind, jaggery or any other spice as required to taste., \u25a2 Blend together mint, cilantro, salt, ginger, garlic, green chilies, roasted cumin powder, sugar, salt and 2 to 3 tbsp cold yogurt to a smooth paste.\u25a2 Whisk yogurt until smooth and stir in the blended paste. Stir in the chaat masala.\u25a2 Taste test and adjust salt, chili and sprinkle lemon juice if required. Serve with kebabs, snacks & sandwiches."

To reduce the soaking time, you may soak them in boiling hot water for 4 to 5 hours.\u25a2 Later drain the water and rinse them well., \u25a2 Pour 4 cups fresh water and pressure cook for 10 whistles on a medium heat. You can also cook in a pot until soft and tender adding more water as needed. If cooking in instant pot, pressure cook on high pressure for 20 mins. \u25a2 Both urad dal and rajma must cook to very soft. When mashed with a spoon the dal and rajma must be soft and get mashed well easily.

        "Instructions": "\u25a2 Rinse together urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds thrice and soak in enough water for 4 to 6 hours.\u25a2 Rinse rice thrice and soak in enough water for 4 to 6 hours. (If you have a high speed blender you may rinse and soak them together, read faqs), \u25a2 Rinse and soak poha in \u00bc cup water for 30 mins, before blending the batter.\u25a2 Drain the water from the dal & transfer to a blender jar along with soaked poha and water. Grind to a smooth & bubbly batter. It should be of thick pouring consistency. Transfer this to a large pot (enough to hold the fermented batter).\u25a2 Drain the water completely from rice & add it to the jar. Pour water and blend to a smooth or slightly coarse batter. It will be of thick pouring consistency.\u25a2 Pour this to the batter bowl and mix well. (Check video to see the final consistency), \u25a2 Cover the bowl loosely and ferment it in a warm place until the batter rises and turns light & bubbly. It may take anywhere from 6 to 18 hours depending on the temperature.\u25a2 If you live in a warm region, you can leave the batter bowl on the counter overnight.\u25a2 To ferment in colder regions, preheat the oven at the lowest setting (120 F/ 50 C) for 7 mins, no longer. Turn off the oven and keep the dosa batter inside with the oven light ON. Alternately, place the batter bowl in your instant pot steel insert, press yogurt settings with a timer set to 8 hours (12 to 14 hours during colder days). Use an external lid and not the IP lid.\u25a2 Optional Fermentation test: Well fermented dosa batter rises & increases in volume. It looks airy, with plenty of tiny bubbles. To test, drop half a spoon of this into a bowl of water. Well fermented batter floats. If it has not reached this stage, ferment longer.\u25a2 Stir the dosa batter once. Transfer the required portion to a small bowl and add salt as required. Refrigerate the rest for up to 1 to 2 weeks.\u25a2 The fermented batter usually becomes thick, pour little water to thin down & bring it to spreadable consistency. (Check video or photos in the post), \u25a2 Heat a dosa griddle/ tawa on a medium heat. When it is slightly hot, add a few drops of oil and spread it with a kitchen paper or a half cut onion (pierced with a fork/ butter knife on the rounded side to hold).This prevents the dosas from sticking to the pan.\u25a2 To check if the pan is hot enough, sprinkle a few drops of water over the pan. If it is ready, it should sizzle.\u25a2 Reduce the heat to low, stir the batter with a ladle and take a ladle (\u00bc cup) of dosa batter & pour in the center of the hot griddle/ tawa.\u25a2 Immediately begin to spread it evenly with the base of the ladle \u2013 starting from the center, in an outward circular motion in a clockwise direction. (Check photos or video in the post)\u25a2 Increase the heat to medium high or high and drizzle oil/ghee/ butter across the edges.\u25a2 Cook until the base turns golden & crisp. Run a thin wooden turner/spatula across the base of the dosa, starting from the edges to the center.\u25a2 Optional \u2013 If you want you may cook on the other side \u2013 turn it to the other side and cook for a minute. Turn again and cook the base for 30 seconds to crisp it.\u25a2 Fold the dosa and remove from pan. Before making the next dosa, reduce the heat to low. You can also rub the cut onion and then pour the batter.\u25a2 Serve dosa with coconut chutney, potato masala & tiffin sambar."

        "Instructions": "\u25a2 Add urad dal & methi seeds to a bowl.  Add rice or idli rava to another bowl. \u25a2 Wash them very well separately until water runs clear. Soak them separately\u00a0 in lot of water for at least 6 hrs.\u00a0\u25a2 Rinse and soak poha with \u00bc cup water for about 30 mins before blending., \u25a2 After 6 hours, drain the water from both the bowls.\u25a2 Add dal, methi, soaked poha, salt & water to a blender jar or a wet grinder.  You may need another 2 to 4 tbsps water while blending.\u25a2 If you live in a hot climate then skip adding salt now and add it just before making idli else the batter turns sour. You will have to experiment with salt to know what works well for you.\u25a2 Blend all of them till thick, smooth, bubbly & frothy. The idli batter should not turn hot or even warm as it makes dense idli.\u25a2 Transfer urad dal batter to a large bowl.\u25a2 A. If using rice : Add rice to the blender with water (mentioned in the ingredients). Grind to a little coarse batter (semolina texture). Pour this to the dal batter. Mix both of them well with your clean hands. The batter must be thick yet of pouring consistency. B. If using idli rava : Drain off the water thoroughly from the rava. Squeeze excess water from the rava with the help of both your palms. Rava must not look soggy. It must absolutely have no water in it, else the batter will become runny.\u25a2 Transfer this to the urad dal batter and mix well.\u25a2 Now mix everything well. Use your hand to mix as it helps to ferment faster and better. If needed can add little water, if the batter is too thick., \u25a2 Set the batter aside in a warm place for at least 8 to 14 hrs. The batter ferments and rises well to double the quantity. Sometimes it may take up to 18 hours depending on the weather and temperature.\u00a0\u25a2 If you live in a cold country, keep it in the oven with the light bulb ON. Or preheat the oven to 120 F or 50 C for 10 to 12 mins. Keep the loosely covered batter bowl inside & turn off. If you have a instant pot or microwave (with yogurt function), then you can also turn it ON with the yogurt setting (low) for 6 to 12 hours or until the batter doubles.\u25a2 A well fermented batter will yield good soft idli. The batter must rise and look fluffy but not turn sour. You will need to experiment to know the fermentation time., \u25a2 On a high flame, bring water to a boil in an idly steamer or a pressure cooker. If using instant pot, pour 1\u00bd cups water to your inner pot. Press the saute button and bring the water to a rolling boil.\u25a2 Meanwhile grease your idly plates lightly. Mix the idli batter gently 1 to 2 times only. Do not over do as the aerated batter will turn flat. Fill the molds with batter.\u25a2 When the water begins to bubble and steam up, place the stand in the steamer.\u00a0Cover and steam for exactly 10 mins on a high flame. If using Instant pot, when the water begins to boil,   press CANCEL button. Keep the idli stand in the IP. Cover with the lid & position the steam release handle to venting . Then press STEAM button. Use an external timer to monitor & steam for 10 to 12 mins.\u25a2 Once done turn off and wait for 2 mins. Remove the idly stand. Set aside to cool down for 2 to 3 mins. When cooled, the idli must not be wet on top.\u25a2 With the help of a spoon remove the idlis to a plate.\u00a0Serve idli with a chutney or sambar."

Add crushed garlic cloves and red chilies. When the garlic begins to smell good, add mustard seeds, cumin seeds and curry leaves (optional). \u25a2 Turn off the stove and stir in red chilli powder and hing (optional).

        "Instructions": "\u25a2 Add urad dal, chana dal and methi seeds to a large bowl. Rinse them well a few times and pour lots of fresh water. To another large bowl, add rice and rinse it well few times. Pour lots of fresh water. \u25a2 Soak for 4 to 5 hours. 30 mins before you begin to make the batter, rinse poha twice. Pour water enough to immerse it fully. Soak it for 30 mins.\u25a2 Later drain the water from the dal completely and add to a blender jar along with poha. \u25a2 Pour 1\u00bc cup water and salt. If you live in a hot weather then skip salt now and add after fermentation.\u25a2 Blend the batter well until thick, frothy and smooth. While you blend ensure your blender doesn't heat up and get overloaded. So give a break in between and blend.\u25a2 Transfer the batter to the bowl in which you soaked the dal. \u25a2 Drain the water from rice completely and add it along with \u00bd cup water to the blender jar. \u25a2 Blend slightly coarse or smooth to suit your liking. I make a slightly coarse batter of fine semolina texture. If needed pour the rest of the \u00bc cup water while blending. I use up full 2 cups water mentioned in the recipe to blend.\u25a2 Pour this rice batter to the dal batter & mix well. You can check the video or step by step photos to know the consistency of batter.\u25a2 I divide the batter to 2 large bowls. You can do the same if you prefer to use it on 2 different days. Cover the bowl., \u25a2 Allow the masala dosa batter to ferment in a warm place for about 6 to 16 hours depending on your weather. The batter has to rise and turn slightly fluffy. Do not over ferment the batter.\u25a2 If you live in a cold place, then preheat the oven to 60 C or 140 F for 10 mins.  Keep the batter inside with the oven light ON.  Or You can also use your instant pot in the yogurt settings., \u25a2 Boil or steam potatoes until just done. Do not cook them until very mushy.\u25a2 Instant pot: You can pressure cook the potatoes in your IP following these timings \u2013 5 mins if using small potatoes, 6 to 7 mins if using medium ones and 10 mins if using large potatoes. \u25a2 Pressure cooking: If using a pressure cooker, then add peeled and diced potatoes to a bowl and pour water to partially cover them. Place it in the pressure cooker and let it whistle thrice.\u25a2 While the potatoes boil, soak 1 teaspoon chana dal and 1 teaspoon urad dal in little hot water so they soften. After 30 mins drain the water from the dal and keep aside. When the pressure releases, remove the potatoes.\u25a2 Heat a pan with oil. Then add cumin, mustard, chana dal and urad dal. Saute until the dals turns golden.\u00a0\u25a2 Then add onions, curry leaves and chilies. Fry until the onions turn lightly golden.\u25a2 Add hing and ginger. Fry until the aroma of ginger comes out.\u25a2 Crumble the potatoes and add them to the pan. Add turmeric and salt along with 2 to 3 tbsps of water. Skip pouring water if your potatoes are too moist or lightly mushy.\u25a2 Saute for 2 to 3 mins. Add coriander leaves. Taste and add more salt if needed. Set this aside., \u25a2 Bring the batter to consistency by adding little water. It must be of thick pouring and spreading consistency. \u25a2 Heat your dosa tawa on a medium heat. If using cast iron pan, when it turns slightly hot, drizzle few drops of oil on it. Insert a fork or a butter knife into a cut onion and rub the oil all over the pan. If using cast iron griddle, you can also season it the previous night.\u25a2 Check if your pan is hot enough by sprinkling little water on it. It is hot enough it will sizzle and the water evaporates. This tip is only for cast iron pan. Do not try this on a non-stick. \u25a2 When the pan is hot enough, stir your batter once and take a ladle full of it. \u25a2 Pour it in the center of the hot tawa. Immediately begin to spread it in a circular motion starting from the center, keep moving your hand in clockwise direction, making circles until you reach the edges of the pan. Refer video or check images below.\u25a2 You can make thick or thin dosas as per your desire. If you are unable to spread the batter, it means the batter is too thick or the pan is too hot. Check the troubleshooting tips above.\u25a2 Pour about half tsp oil or spread \u00bc tsp soft butter around the edges & a little here and there.\u25a2 Cook the masla dosa on a medium heat. Within few minutes, you can see the edges leave the pan. Flip and cook just for 1 minute.\u25a2 Flip it back and cook until the base turns golden and crisp. If making mysore masala dosa, smear the red chutney (recipe below) as desired. Place the curry in one half of the dosa. Fold it or roll it.\u25a2 To make the next dosa, if using cast iron pan repeat the process of rubbing with cut onion. Make sure the tawa is hot enough and not over hot otherwise it will burn the dosa. Do not cook the dosa on low heat as it makes the dosa hard.\u25a2 Serve crispy masala dosa hot with coconut chutney and tiffin sambar., \u25a2 Roast 2 tbsps chana dal until golden along with 6 to 8 dried red chilies. Chilies have to turn crisp.\u25a2 Saute 1 large onions lightly in 1 tsp oil until the raw smell goes off. Add 2 pinches of cumin.\u25a2 Cool everything. Powder the dal and chilies first.\u25a2 Add half tsp tamarind (optional), 2 garlic cloves and salt. Blend till smooth. You will have a thick chutney. If the chutney turns very thick, add 1 to 2 tbsps of water and blend again."

The batter has to sizzle and rise to the surface without browning. This is the correct temperature.\u00a0\u25a2 Pick up each cauliflower floret with a spoon or fingers & gently drop them one by one to the hot oil. The flame has to be medium initially and should be increased slightly as more gobi is added. Avoid disturbing/ stirring them for 1 to 2 minutes, as the coating can easily turn messy.\u25a2 Reduce the flame to medium and fry until the florets turn golden and crisp. Keep stirring in between for even frying. Remove them with a spider, shaking gently to get rid of the excess oil. \u25a2 Transfer to a kitchen tissue/paper towel or a steel colander. Repeat the same steps of adding the rest of the cauliflower florets to the batter, coating them well and then frying them in hot oil until crisp. Oil should be medium hot and not smoking hot, before you fry the next batch.\u25a2 For extra crisp gobi manchurian, you can also refry the once fried gobi again in oil. I usually do not do it as frying them once is good enough to get very good crisp manchurian with this recipe., \u25a2 Optional: Mix together red chili powder with little water (1 tbsp) to a paste and keep aside. This step is optional and is used mainly for the red color.\u00a0\u00a0\u25a2 Prepare the sauce: Add soya sauce, red chili sauce, tomato ketchup, red chili paste, sugar and vinegar to a small bowl and keep this aside. (for gravy version refer the notes section below). \u25a2 Heat oil in a wide pan or wok. Add garlic, ginger and green chilies. Saute for a minute or two. \u25a2 Then add spring onions whites & bell pepper. Saute them on a high flame for 2 mins.\u00a0\u25a2 Pour the sauce and water. Mix well and cook stirring until the sauce turns thick. Add black pepper and turn off the heat.\u25a2 Taste test and adjust the heat and salt levels to your taste. The sauce has to be slightly tangy, sweet & hot. If you want you may add more sauce to preference. \u25a2 Allow the sauce to cool for 1 to 2 mins.\u00a0Add the fried cauliflower and stir gently to coat well with the manchurian sauce.\u25a2 Garnish gobi manchurian with spring onion greens. Serve immediately as a appetizer or as a side with noodles or fried rice."

The batter has to be thick but of flowing consistency. If needed add more water.\u00a0Beat the batter well with a whisk in one direction in a circular motion for 4 mins. The batter will turn smooth., \u25a2 B.\u00a0Method 2:\u00a0For fermentation :\u00a0Mix together maida, besan & turmeric in a bowl. Pour water & make a thick batter of pouring consistency. Cover and ferment for 12 to 24 hours until the batter gets a very mild sour flavor. The batter will not rise, but will have tiny bubbles on top., \u25a2 Heat ghee or oil on a medium heat to fry jalebis. \u25a2 If using oil, then add 1 to 2 tbsp ghee to the oil. This enhances the flavor.\u25a2 Pour 1 tsp lemon juice to the batter & mix.\u00a0Skip the lemon juice if you have fermented the batter.\u25a2 Add soda and mix gently just until combined.\u25a2 Check batter consistency: The prepared batter must be smooth free flowing and thick. Spoon just 2 to 3 tbsp of batter to the sauce bottle to check if the consistency is right.\u25a2 Next check if the oil is hot enough by dropping a small portion of the batter. It has to come up immediately without browning.\u25a2 Now squeeze the bottle gently and move in circular motion to get spiral. If you are getting very\u00a0 thick jalebi, then the batter is thick. Next if you are getting very thin flat jalebis the batter is thin.\u00a0\u25a2 To fix thick batter, add a tbsp or more water. Next to fix thin batter, add a tbsp of maida (all purpose flour).\u00a0Take a look at the pic in the FAQ section to fix the batter.\u25a2 Mix the batter well. Spoon it to the bottle., \u25a2 Ensure oil is hot and the flame set to medium high heat. \u25a2 Squeeze in the batter gently in circular motions starting from the center moving outside. \u25a2 You can also do it the other way.\u00a0 You will get properly shaped ones after making a few.\u25a2 While the jalebi is getting fried, check the syrup.\u00a0It must be slightly hot to warm when the jalebi is dipped into it. If not heat up a bit.\u25a2 The last 1 minute, turn the flame to low and fry the jalebi. This helps to make them extra crisp.\u25a2 When the jalebi is done it turns crisp. Remove it with a skewer and add to the warm sugar syrup directly.\u25a2 Allow to rest for 2 mins. Remove to a plate. Continue to make more jalebis.\u25a2 Serve jalebi hot."

        "Instructions": "\u25a2 Marinate mutton with salt, ginger garlic, turmeric, garam masala or meat masala, chili powder and curd. Yogurt & ginger garlic paste are natural meat tenderizers so they make the mutton succulent.\u25a2 Set aside until you prepare the rest or leave it in the refrigerator to marinate overnight. (When you are ready to cook, leave the cold mutton out on the counter for 30 mins to bring the meat closer to room temperature.), \u25a2 On a low to medium flame, gently heat oil in a pan or pressure cooker. Add the whole spices \u2013 cinnamon, cardamoms and bay leaf (optional), followed by onions & green chilies.\u25a2 Saute until onions turn golden.\u00a0Lower the flame to very low as much as possible.\u00a0 Then transfer the marinated mutton and saute for 5 to 7 mins.\u25a2 Stir in the meat masala & curry leaves (optional), followed by pureed tomatoes.\u25a2 Increase the heat to medium and saute for another 5 to 7 mins, until the raw flavor of tomatoes has reduced. Pour hot water & mix well.\u25a2 To cook in a regular pot: Bring it to a gentle boil and cook covered on a medium heat for 1 hour 30 minutes. Stir well every 12 to 15 minutes and pour more hot water in batches as needed.\u25a2 Stovetop Pressure Cooker: Pressure cook on a medium heat for 4 to 5 whistles, depending on the kind or cooker, meat and size of the mutton pieces. \u25a2 When the pressure drops, open the lid and mix well. If the curry is runny, cook/saute for a few more minutes to evaporate some of the moisture. Your mutton is cooked through when it is tender, flakes easily with a fork and falls off the bone easily. \u25a2 Taste the curry and add more salt if needed. If you feel it is low on flavor, you may sprinkle little garam masala. Garnish with fine chopped coriander leaves.\u25a2 Serve mutton curry hot with rice, tandoori roti, naan or plain paratha."
